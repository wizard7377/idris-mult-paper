\section{Background}

There are a couple constructions we must first define before we discuss the results posited here, however.
Among these are the linear natural numbers, cloning and dropping, as well as existential types

\subsection{Linear Natural Numbers}

While linear values are quite useful in of themselves, they have one very large problem,

\subsection{Existential Types}

Existential types, in regards to dependent types, usually refers to dependent pair ($\Sigma$) types \cite{hottbook}.
In this context, we see the first element of the pair as ``evidence'' for the type of the second element of the pair.
In Idris, this is formalized (in \idris's \citetitle{idris_base}) by stating that the first arguement is runtime erased, in a similar way to which universal quantifiaction is a function that is erased.

However, for our usage here this is not suitaible, as
