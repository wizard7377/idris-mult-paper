\section{Introduction}

One of the more interesting developments in Programming Language Theory is Quantative Type Theory, or QTT.
Based off Girard's linear logic, it forms the basis of the core syntax of Idris 2's core language, and also as a starting point for that of Linear Haskell \cite{idris,linear_haskell,linear_logic,syntax_semantics_linear_types}
